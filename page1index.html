        Kerala, located in the southwestern part of India along the Arabian Sea, is known as “God’s Own Country” for its natural beauty. It is famous for its backwaters, 
        lush green landscapes, beaches, and hill stations. The state’s capital is Thiruvananthapuram, and Malayalam is the official language. Kerala has a rich cultural heritage with 
        traditional dance forms like Kathakali and Mohiniyattam, and festivals such as Onam are celebrated with great enthusiasm. It is also well-known for its Ayurveda treatments and 
        high literacy rate, the highest in India. With its mix of nature, culture, and tradition, Kerala is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.
