       Delhi, the capital territory of India, is a vibrant blend of history and modernity. 
It is divided into New Delhi, the seat of the Indian government, and Old Delhi, known for its historic monuments 
and bustling markets. The city is home to famous landmarks like the Red Fort, India Gate, Qutub Minar, and Humayun’s Tomb. Delhi has a rich cultural heritage influenced by Mughal, 
British, and contemporary Indian architecture and traditions. It is a hub for politics, commerce, education, and tourism, with a 
diverse population and vibrant street food culture. Serving as the heart of the nation, Delhi reflects both India’s past and its rapid progress.
