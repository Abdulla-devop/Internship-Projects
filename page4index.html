     Tripura is a small state in northeastern India, bordered by Bangladesh on three sides and the Indian states of 
Assam and Mizoram. Its capital is Agartala, and Kokborok and Bengali are widely spoken languages. 
Known for its green hills, valleys, and rich tribal culture, Tripura is home to various indigenous 
communities who celebrate colorful festivals and maintain traditional crafts. The state has historical landmarks 
like the Ujjayanta Palace and Neermahal (a water palace), along with temples such as Tripura Sundari. Agriculture, 
especially rice and tea cultivation, plays a major role in its economy. With its blend of natural beauty, 
heritage, and culture, Tripura is a unique part of India’s northeast.
